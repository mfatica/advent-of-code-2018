The main project contains a folder for each day, with a class for each puzzle. 

Each puzzle implements the Puzzle interface, which defines two properties for the input and expected result, and 
a method to solve the puzzle.

There is an accompanying test project that contains a generic solve test for each puzzle, as well as any 
additional tests that are needed.
